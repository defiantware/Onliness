Browser extension that makes the window turn dark when the internet connection is lost.


## Description

Visual aid is important when working with user interfaces, and far too often we notice that the internet connection was lost after we click on something, rather than at the time when it happened.

This extension could help notice janky intrenet connections, an improve the overall browsing experience for many users.

The goal of this project is to cease its existence, as we believe that web browsers, not websites or extensions, should indicate the internet connection status.
