Browser extension that makes the window turn dark when the internet connection is lost.


## Description

Visual aid is important when browsing the web, and far too often the user notices that the internet connection was lost after they click on something, rather than at the time when it happened.

This extension could help notice unstable connections, and improve the overall browsing experience for many users.

The goal of this project is to cease its existence, as we believe that web browsers, not websites or extensions, should indicate the internet connection status.
